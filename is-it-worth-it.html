    <h1>Is it Worth it?</h1>
    <em>September 24th, 2020</em>
    <p>
      I often ask if something is worth it. Is it worth it to buy a car? Is it
      worth it to take this job? Is it worth it to exercise?
    </p>
    <p>
      For some questions, it's easy. Is it worth it to order pickup or delivery?
      I love biking, so picking the food up will cost me a bit of time compared
      to $5 for delivery. If I value my time less than the delivery cost, it's
      worth it. Usually, it is. It's easy to make a pure value judgement when
      the prices are laid out plain and simple. This is a low-risk, positive
      value payoff.
    </p>

      Sometimes, the value judgement is not so simple. Is it worth it to buy
      TSLA? What's the expected payout? Will I lose my money? This question is
      not so easy because I don't know the expected return and I know that the
      investment might be incredibly risky, a high-risk, unknown value payoff.
      Between these two extremes, however, there are many decisions we make when
      we can see the value but we discount it because of the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering if something is worth it, the only factor that matters is
      if the expected payoff is positive, not if it's risky. Risk only becomes a
      factor when the value judgement is not clear.
