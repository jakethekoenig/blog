    <h2>What is loss aversion?</h2>
    <p>
        Most people won't play, even though the expected value of playing is zero (minus transaction fees). This happens
        because humans are <strong>loss averse</strong>: we tend to prefer avoiding losses to equivalent gains. <a
        href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3788">Studies have found</a> that the amygdala may mediate loss aversion by triggering a negative emotional response for losses,
        but not the equivalent magnitude for gains. Our biological response causes us to feel losses about <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:00000000-64a0-5b1c-0000-00003b7ec704/10.05-kahneman-tversky-79.pdf">2-3 times</a>
        worse than the equivalent gains.
    </p>
    <p>
        To model the preference to avoid losses, our utility curve follows
    </p>

    <p>
        Specifically, we value losses much more negatively than the equivalent gain and also that the marginal value of gains or losses decreases as the magnitude increases.
        This asymmetry is known as <strong>loss aversion.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Rationality of loss aversion</h2>
    <p>
        Despite loss aversion being tied to core human behavior, most economists do not consider it to be rational. Consider a business's utility curve for a gain or a loss,
        it is typically linear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unsurprisingly, $1 is worth $1 and $100 is worth $100. Saving $100 is functionally equivalent to making $100. What results here is an asymmetry not just between losses and gains
        but also between rational behavior and human behavior. This suggests that most individuals operate inefficiently.
    </p>
    <h2>Insurance as a mitigation strategy</h2>
    <p>
        A market opportunity exists to exploit this difference. Consider the following two choices.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lose $550 with 100% certainty.</li>
        <li>Lose $1000 with 50% certainty or $0 with 50% certainty.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For the same loss aversion reason, many players will choose option 1: the idea of losing $1000 is harder to stomach than just incurring a $550 loss. Perfectly rational actors, however,
        will choose option 2 because its expected loss is $500. In this case, the $50 difference is known as the <strong>risk premium.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        But we often can't choose our environments, and reality doesn't go according to plan. Sometimes, I'm forced to take option 2, for example when getting a medical bill. Insurance companies
        can aggregate risk across consumers and sell me a health insurance plan that allows me to pay a premium and choose option 1, mitigating the risk that I'll get hit with the $1000 bill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Considering the utility curve, this works because of the difference in magnitude between
    </p>
    <p>
        Extrapolating this observation, industries are founded on market arbitrage. When costs are lower than profits, monetary or otherwise,
        an opportunity is available to convert that to a monetary gain.
    </p>
    <h2>Alternative mitigation strategies</h2>
    <p>
        Insurance isn't the only way to align these curves. <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gill53/AER12.pdf">A recent study</a> posits that competitive environments tend to create
        more loss aversion and 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another approach involves <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22605.pdf">reducing the amount of information that is exposed.</a> Having less information reduces the fear of
        making a wrong decision, lessening the impact of misaligned risk profiles.
    </p>
    <h2>What does that mean for me?</h2>
    <p>
        On a personal level, behavioral economics has taught me something unique. When I'm afraid of something, I try to figure out why I'm afraid of it and identify if it's rational.
        Usually, the true payoff curve is not aligned with what I'm afraid of. Sometimes, that helps make it easier to take risks. In other words, <strong>failing is usually not as bad as it seems.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Put simply, I try to take some risks for the sake of taking them. Being a bit riskier usually will mean I'm closer to risk-neutral than risk-taking after factoring in my biases.
        That's how I capitalize on my personal risk arbitrage.
