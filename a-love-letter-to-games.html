    <h1>A Love Letter to Games</h1>
    <em>October 15th, 2020</em>
    <h2>Act 1: Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      Like many young kids, I learned how to code through video games. On
      February 11th, 2005, I sat in our kitchen while my parents cooked dinner.
      My dad was watching a show called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers"
        >The Screen Savers</a
      >
      on a small CRT TV and they talked about a game called
      <a href="http://blockland.us/">Blockland</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A big Lego fan myself, I jumped to install this game and immediately got
      addicted. I fell in love with the infinite creativity of a building
      sandbox and the ability to talk with complete strangers who all also loved
      the same thing. We'd spend hours making jokes with each other, building
      skyscrapers, coming up with puzzles to solve, all sorts of stuff.
      Blockland predated Minecraft by about six years, but I think many kids
      fall in love with Minecraft for the exact same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockland also had a
      <a href="https://forum.blockland.us/">community forum</a>: a place where
      people would post their creations and talk about life, but most
      importantly for me, talk about how to modify the game. You see, when
      people love something, they want to make it better. I wanted to make
      Blockland better.
    </p>
    <p>One day I discovered a guide to modifying the game.</p>
    <p>
      The first beginnings were simple. Windows Notepad, manual indentation.
      Hours of syntax errors, asking my dad what a variable was. Boundless
      frustration, but all worth it for that dopamine rush when it actually
      works and the thing I built was on the screen in front of me. And more
      importantly, because it was a game, I could share with everyone else who
      loved it too.
    </p>
    <p>Turns out, seven years later those mods still stood the test of time.</p>

    <p>
      I remember my favorite mod was called <em>Custom Shifting</em>. Blockland
      operated in a discretized three-dimensional world, but the Torque Game
      Engine it was built out was fully-featured 3D engine. Some modders
      realized this and added a feature that allowed setting the exact
      orientation of a block. I took this mod one step further and allowed
      players to scale, transform, and rotate with their keyboard, effectively
      turning Blockland into a rudimentary 3D modeling program.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod was also the best geometry lesson I had ever gotten. I actually
      asked my geometry teacher how to do rotations about an arbitrary point via
      matrix multiplication in rectangular coordinates. He told me that I should
      convert everything to polar, do the transformation, then convert it back
      to rectangular. I don't remember much else from that class (sorry Mr
      Stuckey) but I definitely remember that conversation. Turns out I had
      invented something similar to features in real 3D modeling programs like
      Blender.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I had the foresight to screenshot the insanely creative structures
      people made. Everything from racecars to roller coasters, statues to
      skyscrapers. I remember after releasing the mod, suddenly the bar for
      creativity skyrocketed as everyone had millimeter-grained control over
      their Lego bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There really is nothing like seeing someone use your code and run with it.

    <h2>Act 6: The End Game</h2>
    <p>
      I never thought I'd be a software engineer. Throughout school, I thought I
      would end up a physicist, economist, teacher, or something. I knew I liked
      programming but I wasn't the biggest fan of computer science. I only liked
      building tools
