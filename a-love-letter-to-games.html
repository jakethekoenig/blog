    <h1>A Love Letter to Games</h1>
    <em>October 17th, 2020</em>
    <h2>Act I: Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      Like many kids, I learned how to code through video games. On February
      11th, 2005, I sat in our kitchen while my parents cooked dinner. My dad
      was watching a show called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screen_Savers"
        >The Screen Savers</a
      >
      on a small CRT TV and they talked about a game called
      <a href="http://blockland.us/">Blockland</a>.
    </p>
    <video controls>
      <source src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>
      A big Lego fan myself, I jumped to install this game and immediately got
      addicted. I fell in love with the infinite creativity of a building
      sandbox and the ability to talk with complete strangers who all also loved
      the same thing. We'd spend hours making jokes with each other, building
      skyscrapers, coming up with puzzles to solve, all sorts of stuff.
      Blockland predated Minecraft by about six years, but I think many kids
      fall in love with Minecraft for the exact same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blockland also had a
      <a href="https://forum.blockland.us/">community forum</a>: a place where
      people would post their creations and talk about life, but most
      importantly for me, talk about how to modify the game. You see, when
      people love something, they want to make it better. I wanted to make
      Blockland better.
    </p>
    <p>One day I discovered a guide to modifying the game.</p>
    <p>
      The first beginnings were simple. Windows Notepad, manual indentation.
      Hours of syntax errors, asking my dad what a variable was. Boundless
      frustration, but all worth it for that dopamine rush when it actually
      works and the thing I built was on the screen in front of me. And more
      importantly, because it was a game, I could share with everyone else who
      loved it too.
    </p>
    <p>Turns out, seven years later those mods still stood the test of time.</p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-2.png" />
    <p>
      I remember my favorite mod was called <em>Custom Shifting</em>. Blockland
      operated in a discretized three-dimensional world, but the Torque Game
      Engine it was built out was fully-featured 3D engine. Some modders
      realized this and added a feature that allowed setting the exact
      orientation of a block. I took this mod one step further and allowed
      players to scale, transform, and rotate with their keyboard, effectively
      turning Blockland into a rudimentary 3D modeling program.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod was also the best geometry lesson I had ever gotten. I actually
      asked my geometry teacher how to do rotations about an arbitrary point via
      matrix multiplication in rectangular coordinates. He told me that I should
      convert everything to polar, do the transformation, then convert it back
      to rectangular. I don't remember much else from that class (sorry Mr
      Stuckey) but I definitely remember that conversation. Turns out I had
      invented something similar to features in real 3D modeling programs like
      Blender.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-8.png" />
    <p>
      I wish I had the foresight to screenshot the insanely creative structures
      people made. Everything from racecars to roller coasters, statues to
      skyscrapers. I remember after releasing the mod, suddenly the bar for
      creativity skyrocketed as everyone had millimeter-grained control over
      their Lego bricks' position.
    </p>
    <p>
      There really is nothing like seeing someone use your code and run with it.
      I'm still proud of the code I wrote because it was my first taste of
      seeing how I could impact a community with just an idea. Video games
      taught me that I could create anything I wanted to with the right logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Act II: Web Games</h2>
    <p>
      Blockland's community was small though. It wasn't until Neopets,
      Runescape, and Maplestory that I'd realize how much games influenced
      larger communities. The botting communities behind these games were huge!
      Hundreds of thousands of kids coming together to figure out how to
      automate their games to gain an advantage. And the platforms kept trying
      to detect us too. It was sort of an arms race between kids who barely knew
      what HTML was and actual, established engineers.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-3.jpg" />
    <p>
      I remember we'd hack together some
      <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> scripts with some
      basic image detection to spam the games or automatically perform tasks.
      We'd actually publish some of these bots and others would constantly try
      to improve them. It was really like trying to build software without
      having ever learned how to code, but crazily it worked!
    </p>
    <p>
      Web games were also where I managed to start my first actual business,
      growing to about $500k in ARR at its peak. Sometimes I miss the simpler
      days of hacking scripts together and shipping them out. We never wrote
      tests: we didn't even know what they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web games taught me that I had the ability to influence a lot of people
      with the right choices. My code didn't even have to be good, it just had
      to be useful.
    </p>
    <h2>Act III: Alternate Reality Games</h2>
    <p>
      When I moved to college, I started to outgrow the online games I played.
      But gaming always stuck with me. I quickly became the leader of UChicago's
      Humans vs Zombies game, an alternate reality game we'd play on campus. You
      can find a more detailed account of the game's history over
      <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kevin-wang/a-brief-history-of-zombies-at-uchicago/10156595334907727/"
        >at this post</a
      >, but not that much differently from video and web games, I really had no
      idea how to run the game and just dove right in.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-4.jpg" />
    <p>
      We made it work, however. We strove to focus on individual players and try
      to make the experience amazing for everyone. Over the course of my tenure
      running the game, we grew it from zero to 400 players, which was about 10%
      of the undergraduate population at the time. Some of our events had way
      better turnout than I could've ever imagined when I matriculated. After
      all, I was just trying to have some fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what struck me the most was the impact that we had on some of the
      players. Some players said that HvZ was how they found friends. Others
      said that HvZ helped them get through depression. We had built a game that
      got even the most anti-social UChicagoans to have a bit of social life.
      The key was in figuring out how to structure the game so they could build
      the social life that they wanted, not the frat parties imposed on them by
      society.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I hope you read this and other stories of HvZ players and understand that
      it has helped a lot of people be happy in a school that struggles with
      depression. --anonymous player
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Alternate reality games taught me that focusing on game design and
      incentives instead of just telling people what to do can catalyze some
      truly magical moments in the community. I'm really proud of HvZ and to
      this day strive to have the same impact on people that I did in college.
    </p>
    <h2>Act IV: Formal Games</h2>
    <p>
      Besides HvZ, while at UChicago one of my favorite classes was introductory
      game theory. From Prisoner's dilemma to Bayesian games, the idea that
      interactions between players could be modeled and analyzed was astounding.
      Suddenly, so many of the interactions I saw, emergent behaviors and
      choices that people made, could be justified from the simple framework of
      a game.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-5.png" />
    <p>
      It was also right about the time when I was at UChicago that Dr Richard
      Thaler's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudge theory</a>
      started to gain traction. To me, this theory was revolutionary. All the
      economics I had learned before suggested that the best way to influence
      behavior was through direct incentives: taxes and subsidies. But here,
      behavioral economics was saying that another way to influence behavior was
      through small structural changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nudge theory gave credibility our theory for why HvZ worked so well. It
      wasn't just that the game was entertaining: that in itself wouldn't have
      made people socialize. Humans vs Zombies helped people socialize because
      it changed their underlying perception of the world just slightly. It
      nudged them towards cooperating with other players. It gave them a subtle
      cues via a colorful bandana to help people find others who also cared
      about staying alive (figuratively).
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      if you want to get somebody to do something, make it easy --Dr Richard
      Thaler
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Formal game theory showed me that the impact I had with games wasn't a
      fluke or luck, it was actually something structural and could be studied.
      It showed me that if we study for a bit and care about the structures of
      the games we build, then games like Humans vs Zombies can be designed and
      improved. That the unfortunate Nash equilibria could be mitigated by
      nudging prior beliefs.
    </p>
    <h2>Act V: Social Games</h2>
    <p>
      These days, I spend my time on <a href="https://doahuddle.com">Huddle</a>.
      I'm captivated by the idea that technology can connect people and I
      believe that video is a medium that far outclasses any other text-based or
      image-based forum we've seen. Video has a way of humanizing and connecting
      people in a way that is only rivaled by meeting them in person. The only
      reason I think video is better than an in person meeting comes down to a
      nudge: it's easier to hop on video.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-6.jpg" style="max-width: 50%" />
    <p>
      So then the question comes down to: how can we build a video platform that
      emulates meeting people as close as possible? I don't want to build a
      platform that offers artificial connections or tries to be the only place
      to connect, I want video to simply nudge people in the right direction to
      enable them to build those connections on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of my time thinking about my experiences with both playing
      and building games. I think the right approach to a successful platform
      will involve a bit of game theory and a bit of luck to keep incentives
      aligned. Otherwise, we're just shooting in the dark and hoping to be
      successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully, I'll find that building these social games works. I'd love to
      see game theory take a more prominent role in our decision making and I'm
      out to prove that it works. With the tech industry grappling with AI and
      its ramifications, I believe the right answer is just a small nudge away.
    </p>
    <h2>Act VI: The End Game</h2>
    <p>
      Games have always played a special role in my life. They've influenced how
      I see the world and the changes I want to make. The ways that games of all
      types bring people together, directly or indirectly, remains an area that
      I wish were better understood in the industry.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a-love-letter-to-games-7.jpg" style="max-width: 50%" />
    <p>
      And of course, I still play games. As of writing, I've been playing
      <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</a>, loving the
      sports-like strategy and communication involved with a team. I love
      studying incentives and probabilistic game theory and finding new ways to
      build games to foster community and connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't yet found a formalism for why games work so well, but there's
      something magical and I'm sure I'll find it.
